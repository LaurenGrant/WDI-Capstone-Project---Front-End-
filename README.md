# WDI-Capstone-Project---Front-End-

A Cup of Sugar is a web application that is designed to allow users to lend and borrow their neighbor's items.

The site allows user to create a listing for the items they are willing to lend out. The next feature I would love to add is a Google Maps api that will show all locations of where people post their items. 

On the front end of the application I used HTML, CSS, Javascrtipt and utilized the jQuery and Handlebars libraries.
